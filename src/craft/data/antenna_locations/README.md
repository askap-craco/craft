# ASKAP antenna locations in differnet formats

The *.ant files are suiable for miriad

They have filname askap-akN-akM.ant

which is all antennas between antenna N and antenaM.

askap_stations.tab is a file athat Chris Phillips sent through. I'm not sure its format is - no doubt something useful for CALC/VLBI.
