In the first block t=436, and the second at t=181. Recall that the FDMT time (t) is with reference to the time that the FRB goes through the final channel. In this case, the fact that the first block has the FRB arriving at t=436, is saying 436 samples from the beginning of block 1. If the block size is 256, then we'd expec to see the FRB arriving at t=436-256 = 180 samples into block 2 which is (roughly) where we see it arriving. So now what we need is for the for an overlap and sum operation to take in blocks of data and keep the output as required."
